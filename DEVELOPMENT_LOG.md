# Development Log - Bihar Crop Forecasting Project

## August 2025

### Day 1 - Project Setup
- Researched crop forecasting techniques
- Decided to focus on Bihar state due to agricultural importance
- Set up development environment with conda

### Day 2 - Data Collection & Analysis
- Gathered agricultural statistics from government sources
- Analyzed weather patterns affecting crop yields
- Explored satellite data for vegetation indices

### Day 3 - Feature Engineering
- Created lag features for time series patterns
- Engineered weather-crop interaction variables
- Built soil fertility composite indices

### Day 4 - Model Development
- Experimented with XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest
- Implemented ensemble methods for better accuracy
- Added cross-validation for robust evaluation

### Day 5 - API Development
- Built FastAPI endpoints for predictions
- Added input validation and error handling
- Implemented model serving infrastructure

### Day 6 - Dashboard Creation
- Developed Streamlit interface for farmers
- Added interactive parameter controls
- Created visualizations for prediction results

### Day 7 - Testing & Deployment
- Containerized application with Docker
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Conducted end-to-end testing

## Key Learning Outcomes
1. MLOps pipeline development
2. Agricultural domain knowledge
3. Production API deployment
4. Interactive dashboard creation

## Challenges Overcome
