# Bihar Crop Yield Forecasting System

A machine learning-powered application for predicting crop yields across Bihar districts, helping farmers and agricultural planners make better decisions.

## 🌾 About This Project

As someone passionate about technology's role in agriculture, I developed this system to tackle one of India's most pressing challenges - optimizing crop production. Bihar, being one of India's major agricultural states, provided the perfect case study for building a comprehensive yield prediction system.

This project combines my interests in machine learning, web development, and social impact technology.

## 🎯 What It Does

The system predicts crop yields for major Bihar crops (Rice, Wheat, Maize, Sugarcane, Jute) using:
- **Weather patterns** - Temperature, rainfall, humidity data
- **Satellite imagery** - NDVI vegetation health indices
- **Soil characteristics** - pH, nutrients, organic content
- **Historical trends** - Previous yield patterns and seasonal variations

## 🚀 Key Features

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Multiple algorithms**: XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest
- **Smart ensemble**: Dynamic model selection based on crop/season
- **Feature engineering**: 40+ derived features from raw agricultural data
- **Validation**: Cross-validation and performance tracking

### Web Interface
- **REST API**: FastAPI with automatic documentation
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit app for easy parameter adjustment
- **Real-time predictions**: Instant yield forecasts with confidence intervals

### Production Ready
- **Containerized**: Docker setup for easy deployment
- **CI/CD pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive validation and logging
- **Documentation**: Complete API docs and usage examples

## 📊 Performance

The ensemble model achieves:
- **RMSE**: 200-300 kg/hectare
- **R² Score**: 0.85-0.90
- **Response Time**: < 500ms per prediction

Tested on 15,000+ data points spanning 14 years of agricultural records.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Backend**: Python, FastAPI, MLflow  
**ML/Data**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM  
**Frontend**: Streamlit, Plotly  
**DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions  
**Data**: Agricultural statistics, Weather APIs, Satellite imagery

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- 4GB RAM minimum
- Internet connection for initial setup

### Installation
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bihar-crop-forecasting.git
cd bihar-crop-forecasting

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the complete system
python run_project.py
```

The system will automatically:
1. Process the agricultural dataset
2. Train ML models
3. Start API server (http://localhost:8000)
4. Launch dashboard (http://localhost:8501)

## 📱 Usage Examples

### API Prediction
```python
import requests

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/predict", json={
    "district": "Patna",
    "crop": "rice",
    "year": 2024,
    "season": "kharif",
    "weather": {
        "temp_max_c_mean": 35.0,
        "temp_min_c_mean": 22.0,
        "rainfall_mm_sum": 1200.0,
        "humidity_percent_mean": 75.0,
        "solar_radiation_mean": 20.0
    },
    "satellite": {
        "ndvi_mean": 0.7,
        "ndvi_max": 0.85,
        "lai_mean": 3.5,
        "lai_max": 5.0
    },
    "soil": {
        "ph": 7.0,
        "organic_carbon_percent": 0.8,
        "nitrogen_kg_per_hectare": 200.0,
        "phosphorus_kg_per_hectare": 25.0,
        "potassium_kg_per_hectare": 150.0
    }
})

print(f"Predicted Yield: {response.json()['predicted_yield']} kg/hectare")
```

### Dashboard Usage
1. Open http://localhost:8501
2. Select district and crop type
3. Adjust weather and soil parameters
4. Get instant yield predictions with visualizations
